                <h3>Variables - Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>var</li>
                    <li>let</li>
                    <li>const</li>

                </ol>
                <p>When to Use JavaScript var? <br/> Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst. The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015 If you want your
                    code to run in older browser, you must use var.
                </p>
                <p>When to Use JavaScript const? <br/> If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const. If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript Identifiers All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). The general
                    rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are: Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Names must begin with a letter Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this
                    tutorial) Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables) Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names</p>

                <p>In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.<br/> Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.<br>After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is
                    undefined).

                <h3>The Concept of Data Types In programming - data types is an important concept. To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type. Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:</li>
                    <li>A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe". Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:</li>
                    <li>JavaScript has only one type of numbers. Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:</li>
                    <li>Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation</li>
                    <li>JavaScript Booleans Booleans can only have two values: true or false.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. Array items are separated by commas.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}. Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.</li>
                    <li>You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:</li>
                    <li>In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Function A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</h3>
                <p>JavaScript Function Syntax A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
                    The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...) The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

                    <br/><code>function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
                    // code to be executed
                  }</code><br/> Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition. Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked. Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave
                    as local variables.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Function Invocation --- The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function: When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button) When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code Automatically (self
                        invoked).
                    </li>
                    <li>Function Return --- When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement. Functions often
                        compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":</li>
                    <li>Why Functions? You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times. You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.</li>
                    <li>Using the example above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result. Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.</li>
                    <li>Functions Used as Variable Values Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.</li>
                    <li>Local Variables Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.</li>
                    <li>Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.</li>

                    treats primitive values as objects when executing methods and properties. </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>The toString() method returns a number as a string. All number methods can be used on any type of numbers (literals, variables, or expressions):</li>
                    <li>The toExponential() Method toExponential() returns a string, with a number rounded and written using exponential notation. A parameter defines the number of characters behind the decimal point</li>
                    <li>The toFixed() Method toFixed() returns a string, with the number written with a specified number of decimals</li>
                    <li>toPrecision() returns a string, with a number written with a specified length</li>
                    <li>The valueOf() Method valueOf() returns a number as a number.</li>
                    <li>Converting Variables to Numbers There are 3 JavaScript methods that can be used to convert variables to numbers:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Number() method - Returns a number, converted from its argument.</li>
                            <li>The parseInt() method - Parses its argument and returns a floating point number</li>
                            <li>The parseFloat() method - Parses its argument and returns an integer</li>
                            These methods are not number methods, but global JavaScript methods.</ul>

                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Property Description MAX_VALUE Returns the largest number possible in JavaScript MIN_VALUE Returns the smallest number possible in JavaScript POSITIVE_INFINITY Represents infinity (returned on overflow) NEGATIVE_INFINITY Represents negative infinity (returned
                    on overflow) NaN Represents a "Not-a-Number" value
                    <li>MAX_VALUE returns the largest possible number in JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>MIN_VALUE returns the lowest possible number in JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>POSITIVE_INFINITY is returned on overflow.</li>
                    <li>NEGATIVE_INFINITY is returned on overflow.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript String Length The length property returns the length of a string: .length</li>
                <li>Extracting String Parts There are 3 methods for extracting a part of a string:
                    <ul>
                        <li>slice(start, end) - slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string. The method takes 2 parameters: the start position, and the end position (end not included).</li>
                        <li>substring(start, end) - substring() is similar to slice(). The difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0 in substring()</li>
                        <li>substr(start, length) - substr() is similar to slice(). The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part. </li>
                        <li>The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string -- By default, the replace() method replaces only the first match. The replace() method does not change the string it is called on. The replace() method
                            returns a new string. The replace() method replaces only the first match If you want to replace all matches, use a regular expression with the /g flag set. See examples below. To replace case insensitive, use a regular expression
                            with an /i flag (insensitive): To replace all matches, use a regular expression with a /g flag (global match):</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Converting to Upper and Lower Case A string is converted to upper case with toUpperCase(): A string is converted to lower case with toLowerCase():</li>
                <li>JavaScript String concat() .concat() joins two or more strings:</li>
                <li>All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string. Formally said: Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.</li>
                <li>JavaScript String trim() The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string:</li>
                <li>JavaScript String Padding ECMAScript 2017 added two String methods: padStart() and padEnd() to support padding at the beginning and at the end of a string.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The padStart() method pads a string with another string: The padStart() method is a string method. To pad a number, convert the number to a string first. See the example below.</li>
                        <li>The padEnd() method pads a string with another string: The padEnd() method is a string method. To pad a number, convert the number to a string first. See the example below.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>JavaScript String charAt() The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string:</li>
                <li>The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string:</li>
                <li>The charCodeAt() method returns the unicode of the character at a specified index in a string: The method returns a UTF-16 code (an integer between 0 and 65535).</li>
                <li>Property Access ECMAScript 5 (2009) allows property access [ ] on strings: text[0] ; Property access might be a little unpredictable: It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not) If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined,
                    while charAt() returns an empty string. It is read only. str[0] = "A" gives no error (but does not work!)</li>
                <li>JavaScript String split() A string can be converted to an array with the split() method: <code>text.split(",")    // Split on commas
                    text.split(" ")    // Split on spaces
                    text.split("|")    // Split on pipe</code> If the separator is omitted, the returned array will contain the whole string in index [0]. If the separator is "", the returned array will be an array of single characters:</li>

                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true <code>if (condition) {
                        //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
                      }</code></li>
                    <li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false <code>if (condition) {
                        //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
                      } else {

                      }</code></li>
                    <li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false <code>if (condition1) {
                        //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
                      } else if (condition2) {

                      }</code></li>
                    <li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed // The switch expression is evaluated once. The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. If there is a match, the associated block of code
                        is executed. If there is no match, the default code block is executed.When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the execution inside the switch block. It is not necessary to break
                        the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway. Note: If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case. The default Keyword The default keyword
                        specifies the code to run if there is no case match: Switching Details If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected. If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label. If no default
                        label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch. Strict Comparison Switch cases use strict comparison (===). The values must be of the same type to match. A strict comparison can only be true if the operands
                        are of the same type. In this example there will be no match for x.<code>switch(expression) {
                        case x:
                          // code block
                          break;
                        case y:
                          // code block
                          break;
                        default:
                          // code block
                      }</code></li>

                    <h3>JavaScript Loops Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value. Often this is the case when working with arrays:</h3>
                    <ul>Different Kinds of Loops JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

                        <li> for - loops through a block of code a number of times<code>for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
                            // code block to be executed
                          }</code> Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block. Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block. Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
                            Statement 1 Normally you will use statement 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (let i = 0). This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 1 is optional. You can initiate many values in statement
                            1 (separated by comma): And you can omit statement 1 (like when your values are set before the loop starts): <code>let i = 2;
                            let len = cars.length;
                            let text = "";
                            for (; i < len; i++) {
                              text += cars[i] + "<br>";
                            }</code>Statement 2 Often statement 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable. This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 2 is also optional. If statement 2 returns true, the loop will
                            start over again, if it returns false, the loop will end. If you omit statement 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end. This will crash your browser. Read about breaks in a later chapter
                            of this tutorial. Statement 3 Often statement 3 increments the value of the initial variable. This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care, and statement 3 is optional. Statement 3 can do anything like negative increment
                            (i--), positive increment (i = i + 15), or anything else. Statement 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop).
                            <code>let i = 0;
                            let len = cars.length;
                            let text = "";
                            for (; i < len; ) {
                              text += cars[i] + "<br>";
                              i++;
                            }</code> In the first example, using var, the variable declared in the loop redeclares the variable outside the loop. In the second example, using let, the variable declared in the loop does not
                            redeclare the variable outside the loop. When let is used to declare the i variable in a loop, the i variable will only be visible within the loop.</li>
                        <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object The For In Loop The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object: <code>const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

                            let text = "";
                            for (let x in person) {
                              text += person[x];
                            }</code>The for in loop iterates over a person object Each iteration returns a key (x) The key is used to access the value of the key The value of the key is person[x] The JavaScript for in statement can also loop over the
                            properties of an Array: <code>const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

                                let txt = "";
                                for (let x in numbers) {
                                  txt += numbers[x];
                                }</code> Do not use for in over an Array if the index order is important. The index order is implementation-dependent, and array values may not be accessed in the order you expect. Array.forEach() The forEach() method calls
                            a function (a callback function) once for each array element. <code>const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

                                    let txt = "";
                                    numbers.forEach(myFunction);
                                    
                                    function myFunction(value, index, array) {
                                      txt += value;
                                    }</code> Note that the function takes 3 arguments: The item value The item index The array itself</li>
                        <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object. It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and
                            more: <code>for (variable of iterable) {
                                // code block to be executed
                              }</code> variable - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable. Variable can be declared with const, let, or var. iterable - An object that has iterable properties. </li>
                        <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. <code>while (condition) {
                            // code block to be executed
                          }</code> In the following example, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 10: <code>Example
                            while (i < 10) {
                              text += "The number is " + i;
                              i++;
                            }</code></li>
                        <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true. The Do While Loop The do while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition
                            is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true. <code>do {
                                // code block to be executed
                              }
                              while (condition);</code> The example below uses a do while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested. Comparing
                            For and While If you have read the previous chapter, about the for loop, you will discover that a while loop is much the same as a for loop, with statement 1 and statement 3 omitted. The loop in this example uses a for loop
                            to collect the car names from the cars array:</li>

                    <h3>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. JavaScript has 3 types of scope: Block scope Function scope Global scope</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Block Scope Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside
                            a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:</li>
                        <li>Local Scope Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables have Function Scope: They can only be accessed from within the function. Since local variables are only recognized inside
                            their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.</li>
                        <li>Function Scope JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope. Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar
                            when declared inside a function. They all have Function Scope:</li>
                        <li>Global JavaScript Variables A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL. A global variable has Global Scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. Global Scope Variables declared Globally (outside any
                            function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have Global Scope: Do
                            NOT create global variables unless you intend to. Your global variables (or functions) can overwrite window variables (or functions). Any function, including the window object, can overwrite your global variables and functions.</li>
